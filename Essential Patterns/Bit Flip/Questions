1. Flip All Bits: Given a binary string, flip all the bits (convert 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).
2. Count Bit Flips to Convert A to B: Given two integers A and B, find the number of bits you need to flip in A to convert it to B.
3. Minimum Bit Flips to Make Binary String Alternating: Given a binary string, find the minimum flips required to make it alternating (010101 or 101010).
